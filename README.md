# Information
I want to thank all your lovely reactions and messages on the alt:V Discord as well as in my private messages. Please accept that I don't want to receive private messages anymore. And yes after I released it I felt much better, I am happier and more satisfied with my life again.

I have released everything to distance myself from the project, 
- I do not help you with the setup
- I do not help you understand code
- I don't care if you can do anything better
- I don't care if it works better somewhere
- I don't care what you do with it
